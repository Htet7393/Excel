Welcome to out spreadsheet. 
Our spreadhsheet replicates the functions of a spreadshee in Microsoft Excel .However, in order to write in the cells,pleae tyoe in the cell content textbox.If you are writing a formula make sure to use the '=' sign.
Cell value will be displayed in the cell value text box and the cell itself.
But content will be in the cell content box.
In order to move from cell to cell,you cane use the arrow buttons i.e Up, down,Left, right and use the enter button on the spreadsheet or on your keyboard to enter something.
If you click the button "file", you will get a dropdown menu that will  allow you to create a new spreadsheet with the button new. 
It will allow you to open pre-existing spreadsheet with the button Open. 
The save button will allow you to save a spreadsheet WHICH ALREADY HAS BEEN SAVED USING THE SAVED AS Button.
The Save As and Open buttons will open a message box allowing you to save the file or open a file from wherever you 
chose too. 
You can close your spreadsheet with the button close too.

GUI
Our interface consists of an infinite number of cells with a colourfull background.
We have included drop down menu's to save and open a file etc.

Resources
To keep track of dependencies amongst cells, we used code from our dependency graph.
To check if a formula is valid or can be easily evaluated we used our formula class.
